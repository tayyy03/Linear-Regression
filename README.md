# Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Predicting House Prices.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of predicting house prices using a machine learning model.

## Code Explanation

The notebook contains a Python script that uses a pre-trained model to make predictions for the first five houses in a dataset. The features for each house are reshaped into a 2D array before being passed into the model's `predict` method. The predictions are then stored in a list.

Here is the main part of the script:

```python
pred_list = []
for i in range(0, 5):
    pred = model.predict(X.iloc[i].values.reshape(1, -1))  # Assuming X is your features for prediction
    pred_list.append(pred)

print(pred_list)
```

## Output
The output of the script is a list of predicted prices for the first five houses in the dataset. The actual output will depend on the specific model and data used.

## Dependencies
The script uses the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
Usage
To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. You can then clone this repository and open the notebook in Jupyter.

## Future Work
Future improvements could include using a larger dataset, tuning the model's hyperparameters, or trying different machine learning algorithms.
